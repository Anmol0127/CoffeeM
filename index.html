                <h1>What makes our coffee ☕️ special?</h1>
                <p>
                <h4>We wanted to take this time to let you know how grateful we are to have you choosing us for your
                    coffee needs. Quality coffee is a passion for us and we are so thankful for your patronage which
                    allows me to do this. We wanted to share a little about our coffees, and why we think they are so
                    special. First of all, we buy our coffee from only the most reputable farms and mills.</h4><br>
                <h2>Not too small. </h2><br>
                <h4>Most boutique coffee companies sell an estate coffee, called this because every bean comes from
                    their estate which may be an acre or two of planted coffee – exactly how we started out. When
                    the beans are picked and dried, they end up in a variety of sizes or grades. These boutique
                    companies roast all beans of varying size together because they cannot afford to waste any beans
                    regardless of quality and they don’t have enough beans for it to make sense to separate them
                    into different grades. What you end up with is an inconsistent roast – the larger beans might
                    not be roasted enough, while the smaller beans are roasted too much and taste burnt. Our
                    “Estate” coffee is from a single grade so you get a much more uniform roast at the perfect
                    temperature for that size.</h4><br>
                <h2>Not too big.</h2><br>
                <h4>The largest companies must buy huge amounts of coffee bean as cheaply as possible, which
                    typically results in lower quality beans. Low quality beans have less flavor, so these companies
                    roast the coffee darker to hide imperfections in the coffee and eke out as much flavor as
                    possible, regardless of what that flavor ends up being. But the flavor you often taste is
                    over-roasted or burnt. Consider a top grade tuna or beef.Same thing with coffee. If you’ve ever had
                    Starbucks coffee you might already be familiar with the
                    burnt taste I’m talking about, which they hide with caramel, whip cream, and other goodies.
                    There is nothing wrong with that. It’s just not what we do.</h4><br>
                <h2>Our coffee ☕️ is just right. </h2><br>
                <h4>We buy only from reputable farmers and millers at volumes equal to several hundred acres. We
                    grade our coffees into different sizes and quality, throw out the lower quality beans and blind
                    taste our grades and types individually to find the best roasting temperature that bring out the
                    best taste for that specific size and coffee bean – different roasting temperatures for
                    different coffee. We do this constantly to maintain a consistent and high-quality roast every
                    time.

                        powder, chocolate syrup or melted chocolate.</p>

                        2/3 water, depending on the coffee shop in question or how you've chosen to brew it.
                        Traditionally, there will be no milk but some people may add it depending on their personal
                        preference. Whilst most other espresso-based coffee drinks include milk, such as the cappuccino
                        or latte, the americano coffee stands out amongst them.</p>

                    <p>Espresso is a full-flavored concentrated form of coffee that is usually served in shots. It is
                        made from the same beans as coffee but it is stronger and higher in caffeine. Espresso is made
                        by forcing pressurized hot water through very finely ground coffee using an espresso machine.
                        You can make espresso coffee with a variety of coffee beans and different roast degrees.</p><br>
